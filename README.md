# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

## Description

I built this project as part of the Foundations course with the Odin Project. As my first larger project in JavaScript, this project is my response to the prompt wherein students are challenged to "teach" the browser console how to play Rock Paper Scissors with the console using JS methods such as if/else if/else statements, comparisons, functions/function expressions, and more. 

In the original version, I took an extra step to gather knowledge about loops in order to implement one here. In addition, I took a step further with the challenge prompt by going from Rock Paper Scissors to Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, a more challenging but altogether similar version of the original game made famous by the sitcom, "The Big Bang Theory." This project got me much better acquainted with debugging, proofreading, and understanding errors within my code. 

More recently, I have elaborated on this project by designing and implementing a UI layout. This exercise helped me to reinforce and expand my CSS skills, including hover and disabled states, and additional properties such as transition and cursor.
